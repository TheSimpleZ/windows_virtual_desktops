# windows_virtual_desktops
A Nim library to interact with virtual desktops on Windows 10.

This library wraps https://github.com/Ciantic/VirtualDesktopAccessor.

It provides a high level API with user friendlier types as well as the original low-level C++ API.

This library is still under development. It does not provide all methods available in VirtualDesktopAccessor and lacks documentation. However, it's fully functional, and any PRs that exposes more methods are welcome.
